features: ['DURABLE CONVERTIBLE LAPTOP, PERFECT FOR SCHOOL.\nThis\xa011.6" convertible laptop has four versatile modes, is reinforced to withstand the physical demands of the primary school experience, and is equipped with the necessary features and software to create and nurture a digital learning environment.\n\n\nRugged Construction\nA rubber bumper around the top cover absorbs the force of side bumps. The corners are 50 percent stronger, to reduce damage when dropped at an angle. The bezel is thicker, to protect the LCD panel, and a stronger rear cover reduces accidental LCD damage. The hinges and brackets have been strengthened, to last 50,000 cycles and to withstand more force to the cover. Reinforced ports and a reduced gap between anchored keys help prevent accidental damage from a bored child\'s exploring fingers. This is one tough machine.\n\n\nMultimode Versatility\nEasily change between four modes –\xa0Laptop, Stand, Tablet, and Tent\xa0– for whatever you choose to do. This device’s unique design and touchscreen display allow the screen to flip 360 degrees, so you can select the mode that best matches your needs at the time.\n\n\nDragontrail® Glass Multitouch Display\nScratch- and crack-resistant, Dragontrail glass is far tougher than typical soda-lime glass. Six times stronger than conventional glass, a 1.1-millimeter sample can withstand 60 kg of weight! But it’s still sensitive enough to read your multitouch commands with greater precision and faster response times.\n\n\nMIL-SPEC Tested\nMilitary-specification testing validates the ruggedness, durability, and quality of ThinkPad products by testing against eight parameters: high pressure, humidity, vibration, high temperature, temperature shock, low pressure (15,000 ft), low temperature, and dust.\n\n\nThinkVantage Active Protection System (APS)\nFor models with traditional hard drives, an accelerometer detects movement and stops the drive when a fall or similar event is detected. Rubber mounts are used for the hard disk drive (rather than rails) and the HDD connector is not rigidly attached to the board, so the connector absorbs shock and impact and protects against system damage.\n\n\nIntel® Education Software\nThinkPad 11e comes standard with a suite of education software titles, including Kno Textbooks, ArtRage, and Classroom Management. Intended for use by students and educators alike, the software enables critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and managed focus, truly creating a 21st century learning environment.\n\n\nFast Data Transfer\nMove data between the 11e and other devices quickly with USB 3.0 — it\'s up to 10 times faster than previous USB technologies and backward-compatible with USB 2.0.\nIntegrated HD Webcam\nThe low-light-sensitive, 720p HD webcam with face-tracking, plus dual digital-array microphones, will help you enjoy web conferences or online video chats like you\'re really there.\n\n\nStereo Speakers with Dolby® Advanced Audio™\nThis suite of audio technologies enables your ThinkPad to deliver a crisp, clear surround sound experience over its built-in stereo speakers. The technology increases audio clarity for VoIP applications, maximises volume output without distortion, and improves dialogue clarity when watching videos. Enjoy an immersive surround sound experience whether listening to a lecture or kicking back with a movie.\n\n\nPowered USB Port\nEnjoy the benefits of an always-on port, charging your USB devices without having to turn on your laptop.\n\n\nHDMI Output\nFor easy connection to a television or other display.\n\n\nTech Specs\nProcessor\nIntel® Celeron® Processor\xa0N2940 (2M Cache, up to 2.25 GHz)\nOperating System\nWin 10 Trial\nDisplay\n11.6" HD (1366x768), glare, 270 nits, IPS, Touch, with Dragontrail Glass Protection\nGraphics\nIntel HD Graphics in processor\nMemory\n4GB\xa0(1 SO-DIMM slot), PC3-12800 1600MHz DDR3L, non-parity; 8GB max\nWebcam\nIntegrated 720p HD Camera\nStorage\n128GB\xa0SSD, SATA 3.0Gb/s, 2.5"\n\nHinge\nYoga hinge 360°\nBattery\n4-cell Li-Ion integrated battery (35Wh)\nKeyboard\nThinkPad Windows keyboard, 6-row, multimedia Fn keys\nAudio support\nHD Audio, Realtek® ALC283 codec, Dolby® Advanced Audio™ v2 / stereo speakers, 2W x 2 / monaural digital microphone, combo audio/mic jack\nWireless LAN\nIntel® Dual Band Wireless-N 7260 (2x2, 802.11abgn) with Bluetooth 4.0\nPorts\n1 x USB 3.0\n1 x USB 2.0 (AlwaysOn)\nCombo audio/microphone jack\nEthernet (RJ45)\n4-in-1 card reader (, SD, SDHC, SDXC)\nHDMI\n\nSecurity keyhole', 'Intel® Celeron® Processor\xa0N2940 (2M Cache, up to 2.25 GHz)', 'Win 10 Trial', '11.6" HD (1366x768), glare, 270 nits, IPS, Touch, with Dragontrail Glass Protection', 'Intel HD Graphics in processor', '4GB\xa0(1 SO-DIMM slot), PC3-12800 1600MHz DDR3L, non-parity; 8GB max', 'Integrated 720p HD Camera', '128GB\xa0SSD, SATA 3.0Gb/s, 2.5"', 'Yoga hinge 360°', '4-cell Li-Ion integrated battery (35Wh)', 'ThinkPad Windows keyboard, 6-row, multimedia Fn keys', 'HD Audio, Realtek® ALC283 codec, Dolby® Advanced Audio™ v2 / stereo speakers, 2W x 2 / monaural digital microphone, combo audio/mic jack', 'Intel® Dual Band Wireless-N 7260 (2x2, 802.11abgn) with Bluetooth 4.0', '1 x USB 3.0', '1 x USB 2.0 (AlwaysOn)', 'Combo audio/microphone jack', 'Ethernet (RJ45)', '4-in-1 card reader (, SD, SDHC, SDXC)', 'Security keyhole', 'Display:\xa011.6" HD', 'Resolution: 1366x768 pixels', 'Storage: 4GB RAM + 128GB SSD', 'Processor: Intel® Celeron® Processor', 'OS:\xa0Win 10 trial', 'Graphics:\xa0Intel HD Graphics in processor', '', 'SKU: LE842CL14GMFJNAFAMZ', 'Model: Thinkpad 11e', 'Size (L x W x H cm): 8.2 x 12 x 0.8 in', 'Weight (kg): 1.5', 'Main Material: PVC', 'Warranty Address: 6 Months (Star Mall, Tom Mboya Street)', '5\n(37)', '4\n(10)', '3\n(4)', '2\n(6)', '1\n(8)', 'Help Center', 'Contact Us', 'Track Your Order', 'Shipping and delivery', 'Pick-up Stations', 'Return Policy', 'How to Order?', 'Dispute Resolution Policy', 'Corporate and Bulk Purchase', 'Advertise with Jumia', 'Report a Product', 'Jumia Payment Information Guidelines', 'Black Friday', 'About us', 'Returns and Refunds Policy', 'Jumia Careers', 'Jumia Express', 'Terms and Conditions', 'Store Credit Terms and Conditions', 'Privacy Notice', 'Cookies Notice', 'Flash Sales', 'Jumia Global', 'Sell on Jumia', 'Vendor Hub', 'Become a Sales Consultant', 'Become a Logistics Service Partner', 'Jumia City Partner Program', 'Algeria', 'Ivory Coast', 'Egypt', 'Ghana', 'Morocco', 'Nigeria', 'Senegal', 'Uganda', 'Adidas', 'AILYONS', 'Apple', 'Asus', 'Bruhm', 'Canon', 'Cantu', 'Coke', 'DELL', 'Dove', 'Dr. Rashel', 'Epson', 'Garnier', 'Hisense', 'HP', 'Infinix', 'Itel', 'Jameson', "L'Oréal Paris", 'Lenovo', 'Logitech', 'Maybelline', 'Mika', 'NIVEA', 'Nunix', 'Oppo', 'Ramtons', 'Roch', 'Samsung', 'Sandisk', 'Skyworth', 'Sony', 'TCL', 'Tecno', 'Transcend', 'Tusker', 'USN', 'Vision Plus', 'Vitron', 'VON', 'XIAOMI']

rating: 5, title: The real deal!! Just perfect. 5 stars!!!, body: The very best and looks very nice!!!
rating: 4, title: Mostly Good, body: The charger came with a 2 prong US style plug and an adapter. The adapter is faulty. Thankfully I have universal extension cables. Would have been better with a square plug instead. Also the A/V found some malware deep within the system, but handled it. This is the only reason for 4 stars out of 5.
